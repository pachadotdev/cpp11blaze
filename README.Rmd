VERY EARLY STAGE PACKAGE!!!

The goal of cpp11blaze is to provide a novel approach to use the [Blaze
C++ library](https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze/src/master/) by using the
header-only cpp11 R package and to simplify things for the end-user.

The idea is to pass matrices/vectors from R to C++, write pure C++/Blaze
code for the computation, and then export the result back to R with the proper
data structures.

This follows from the same goals as cpp11:

* Enforcing copy-on-write semantics.
* Improving the safety of using the R API from C++ code.
* Using UTF-8 strings everywhere.
* Applying newer C++11 features.
* Having a more straightforward, simpler implementation.
* Faster compilation time with lower memory requirements.
* Growing vectors more efficiently.

If this software is useful to you, please consider donating on
[Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will
be used to continue improving `cpp11blaze`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cpp11blaze from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp11blaze")
```

## Examples

I have provided a package template for RStudio that also works with VS Code.

The idea of this package is to be naive and simple (like me).

From RStudio/VSCode create a new project and run:

```r
cpp11blaze::pkg_template()
```

Then follow the instructions from the README.

The vignettes contains detailed examples that I use to test `cpp11blaze`,
these include Ordinary Least Squares.

# Linear Algebra Libraries

Blaze supports OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, and the Accelerate framework (Mac). You
can install OpenBLAS on Debian-based systems with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
```

You can also use other commands for your specific operating system.

To verify that R is using OpenBLAS, you can run `sessionInfo()` after restarting
R to check the BLAS/LAPACK libraries in use:

```r
Matrix products: default
BLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 
LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so; LAPACK version 3.10.0
```
