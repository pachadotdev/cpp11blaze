\usage{

\description{
Vendoring is the act of making your own copy of the 3rd party packages your
project is using. It is often used in the go language community.
}
\details{
This function vendors cpp11 and cpp11blaze into your package by copying
the cpp11 and cpp11blaze headers into the `inst/include` folder and
adding 'cpp11 version: XYZ' and 'cpp11blaze version: XYZ' to the top of
the files, where XYZ is the version of cpp11 and cpp11blaze currently
installed on your machine.

Vendoring places the responsibility of updating the code on
you. Bugfixes and new features in cpp11 and cpp11blaze will not be
available for your code until you run `cpp_vendor()` again.
}
\examples{
# create a new directory
dir <- tempdir()
dir.create(dir)

# vendor the cpp11 headers into the directory
cpp_vendor(dir)
